**Quick Sort** is a highly efficient sorting algorithm based on the divide-and-conquer paradigm. It operates by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1. **Choose Pivot**: Select a pivot element (commonly the last element).
2. **Partitioning**:
   - Rearrange the elements such that all elements less than the pivot are on the left, and all elements greater are on the right.
3. **Recursive Sorting**:
   - Recursively apply the above steps to the sub-array of elements with smaller values and separately to the sub-array of elements with greater values.

**Characteristics:**

- **In-Place Sorting**: Requires only a small, constant amount of additional storage space.
- **Not Stable**: Equal elements may not retain their original positions.
- **Efficient on Average**: Generally performs well, but the performance can degrade with certain inputs (e.g., already sorted arrays).

**Applications:**

- Suitable for large datasets where average performance is crucial.
- Commonly used in standard libraries and systems where in-place sorting is needed.

**Visualization Insights:**

- Observe how the pivot selection and partitioning rearrange the array.
- Swapping elements causes bars to move to their new positions.

      spaceComplexity: "O(n)",
      description: `
**Merge Sort** is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1. **Divide**:
   - Split the array into two halves until each sub-array contains a single element.
2. **Conquer**:
   - Recursively sort each sub-array.
3. **Combine**:
   - Merge the sorted sub-arrays to produce new sorted sub-arrays until there is only one sub-array remaining.

**Characteristics:**

- **Stable Sorting**: Maintains the relative order of equal elements.
- **Not In-Place**: Requires additional memory proportional to the size of the input array.
- **Consistent Performance**: Guarantees O(n log n) time complexity in all cases.

**Applications:**

- Preferred when stability is required.
- Efficient for sorting linked lists.
- Suitable for external sorting (sorting large amounts of data that do not fit in memory).

**Visualization Insights:**

- Notice how the array is divided and merged.
- Overwriting elements during merging shows how sub-arrays are combined.
